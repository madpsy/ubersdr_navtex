# Checks that src/pcm_v4.hpp agrees with the server's audio protocol version 4
# encoder, by decoding streams the SERVER produced and hashing the samples.
#
# This needs no server and no network: testdata/*.bin are recorded packet
# streams and the hashes below are of the samples that went into them.
#
# It matters more than it looks.  The version 4 predictor is backward adaptive
# — the encoder and this decoder derive their filter taps independently from
# the samples already seen and never exchange a coefficient — so an arithmetic
# difference between the two (a rounding rule, a sign convention, the point at
# which the tap clamp is skipped) produces plausible-sounding noise rather than
# an error.  Nothing short of comparing the actual samples catches it.
#
#   pcmv4_stream.bin     ordinary mono audio, silent packets carrying no body,
#                        an escape to verbatim samples, a sample-rate change and
#                        the interleaved I/Q other UberSDR clients use.
#   pcmv4_rice_edge.bin  a Rice codeword whose unary run is exactly 63 bits long
#                        and is counted out of a full 64-bit accumulator, so the
#                        decoder shifts by 64.  Go defines that as zero and C++
#                        does not, and the difference is silent.
#
# Usage:
#   ./run.sh                     # compiles the decoder standalone with g++
#   ./run.sh path/to/binary      # uses a binary CMake already built
